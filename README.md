# nasa-sensor-suite
A sensor suite that uses the JS library Leaflet to generate a topographic heatmap for the area with data for various environmental factors

What is currently done:

    We have a radiation and GPS sensor linked with Arduino
    We have a basic front-end for the heatmap visualization

What we need:

    Linking the Arduino to the ground-based PC (likely with a loRaWAN and Raspberry Pi)
    Full development of the front-end
    Proper back-end data storage via CSV files
    Potentially adding more types of sensors to the sensor suite?
